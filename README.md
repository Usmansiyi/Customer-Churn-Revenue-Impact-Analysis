# Project Title: Customer-Churn-Revenue-Impact-Analysis 




## Project Overview
**This analysis evaluates customer churn behavior and its direct financial impact across contracts, services, customer tenure, and support experience. The objective is to identify key churn drivers, revenue leakage, and high-value customers at risk, and to highlight actionable retention opportunities.**

## Business Problem

Customer churn represents a major revenue risk in the telecom industry. While churn rates are often tracked, organizations struggle to:

*Understand why customers leave

*Identify which customers matter most financially

*Act early to prevent churn before revenue is lost

This dashboard addresses these challenges by combining customer behavior, service usage, support experience, and revenue metrics into a single analytical view.
  
**Key metrics include:**

Total Customers: **7,043**

Churn Rate: **26.5%**

Customers Churned: **1,869**

Customers at Risk: **5,680**

Total Revenue: **$16.1M**

Revenue Lost to Churn: **$139K per month**

Revenue at Risk: **$218K per month**

High-Value Customers at Risk: **2,446**



- **Key Findings**:
  
**1. Contract Type Is the Strongest Churn Driver**

**Month-to-month customers account for:

**42.7% churn rate

**$121K/month revenue loss

**Two-year contracts show the lowest churn (2.8%) and minimal revenue loss.

**Insight:** Short-term contracts drive both customer attrition and financial exposure.



**2. Early Tenure Customers Are Highly Vulnerable**

**Customers in their first 0–11 months show 48.3% churn

**Churn steadily declines with tenure, reaching 9.6% after 48 months

**Insight:** Churn is an early-lifecycle problem, not a long-term loyalty issue.



**3. Fiber Optic Customers Represent the Largest Revenue Risk**

**Fiber Optic contributes:

**41.9% churn

**$114K/month in lost revenue

  **Despite being a premium service, Fiber users exhibit high dissatisfaction.

**Insight:** High-paying customers churn when service expectations are unmet.



**4. Support Experience Is a Critical Revenue Indicator**

**Customers with 5+ support tickets have 54.1% churn

**High ticket volume combined with high monthly charges correlates strongly with churn in the revenue risk analysis.

**Insight:** Poor service resolution directly converts into revenue loss.



**5. Payment Behavior and Household Structure Influence Retention**

**Electronic check users show the highest churn (45.3%)

**Customers with partners or dependents churn significantly less

**Insight:** Automated payments and family-based plans improve retention.

**6. Add-On Services – Retention Boosters**

Customers without value-added services show higher churn:

Online Security: 15% churn

Tech Support: 15%

Device Protection: 22.5%

Streaming Services: ~30%

**Insight:** Support & protection services reduce churn, while entertainment alone does not.


## Reports
- **Business Impact**: 

*Total monthly exposure (lost + at risk) exceeds $350K

*Revenue loss is concentrated among specific, identifiable segments

*Even long-term customers are vulnerable when service quality declines.

## Recommendations
-Convert high-value month-to-month customers to long-term contracts

-Strengthen onboarding and engagement in the first 12 months

-Prioritize service quality for Fiber Optic customers

-Trigger proactive retention actions for customers with ≥3 support tickets

-Incentivize auto-pay and bundled household plans

## Conclusion  
Customer churn is driven less by demographics and more by contract structure, service experience, and early customer lifecycle management. Targeted interventions focused on high-value, high-risk customers can significantly reduce churn and protect recurring revenue.
